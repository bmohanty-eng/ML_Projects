This model uses KMeans and PCA to cluster similar companies together using stock market movements.

This explores the following topics:

1. Importing data from URL (Yahoo Finance)
2. creating Data dictionary of Company names and their tickers
3. sort and lambda function to sort the data.

4. Use pandas_reader.data.DataReader to load the desired stock data
5. Transpose the stock_close and Open data (either using np or Pandas) 
6. Subtract the values to calculate movements.(use np or Pandas) 

7. Visualization of the Data (EDA)
8. Use subplots to visualize (say) 2 companies
9. Normalize the data so the stock movements are normalized. Else the algorithm will group based on size vs. stock movement pattern
Use standard scaler or normalizer from sklearn.preprocessing and compare the stock movements
10. Perform KMeans (use pipeline in scikit learn if needed). Use 10 clusters (can play with cluster #s).

11. Implement PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data set to 2
12. Then run KMeans again on the new dataset to plot and visualize
